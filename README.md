Tyrus 1.x is the open source compatible implementation of [Jakarta WebSocket](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/) 1.1 - a standard API for easy development of WebSocket applications. It is also 
a reference implementation of [JSR-356](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356) - Java API for WebSocket. 

Tyrus 2.0.x is a compatible implementation of [Jakarta WebSocket](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/) 2.0.

Tyrus 2.1.x is a compatible implementation of [Jakarta WebSocket](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/) 2.1.

WebSocket protocol defined by IETF provides bi-directional communication between 
the server and the remote host. The pros are mainly the ability to communicate 
both ways, low latency and small communication overhead. Therefore Tyrus and 
WebSocket in general are suitable for web applications that require sending 
a huge volume of relatively small messages like online games or market ticker 
broadcasting.
