# Eclipse Tyrus

Eclipse Tyrus is the open source
<a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.websocket">JSR 356 - Java API for WebSocket</a>
reference implementation
for easy development of WebSocket applications.Eclipse Tyrus is also 
a Jakarta WebSocket 2.0 compatible implementation.

 WebSocket protocol defined by IETF 
provides bi-directional communication between the server and the remote host. The
pros are mainly the ability to communicate both ways, low latency and small
communication overhead. Therefore Tyrus and WebSocket in general are suitable for web
applications that require sending a huge volume of relatively small messages like
online games or market ticker broadcasting.

## Building Eclipse Tyrus

Building Tyrus can be done using `mvn clean install`, but sometimes (such as for building 2.x from a tag) 
`mvn clean install -Pstaging` would be required.
