# Tyrus

Tyrus is the open source
<a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.websocket">JSR 356 - Java API for WebSocket</a>
reference implementation
for easy development of WebSocket applications. WebSocket protocol defined by IETF
provides bi-directional communication between the server and the remote host. The
pros are mainly the ability to communicate both ways, low latency and small
communication overhead. Therefore Tyrus and WebSocket in general are suitable for web
applications that require sending a huge volume of relatively small messages like
online games or market ticker broadcasting.
